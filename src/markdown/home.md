# Welcome to Bare

## What it does?

Bare create an empty bootstrap project for you. Create it in your own way once so you don't have to set your project anymore. You can get bootstrapes not created by other developers from GitHub. Publish your own Bare.

For eg.
Sometimes `create-react-app` can't meet your needs for creating react project, it still require some change you would be comfortable with while starting your project. `bare` creates a boilerplate and you just add your flavours once and you can use it anytime you want!!

## Bare provides the following functionality

- Save your boilerplate code and all your config files so you don't have to write again and again.
- Generate all boilerplate and config files with a single command
- Customize with `recipe.json`
- Store all your boilerplate to Github
- Public and private boilerplate
